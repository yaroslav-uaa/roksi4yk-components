// The purchase flow: one call that turns a plan id into a Wix-hosted checkout URL.
// Purchasing a plan is a MEMBER action, but the hosted flow handles member login/signup,
// the order form, and payment itself — so this works from an anonymous visitor session.
// Never create the order yourself (orders.createOnlineOrder needs a logged-in member and
// still leaves payment unhandled); never hand-build a checkout URL. Copy as-is.
// docs: https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-management/headless/redirects/create-redirect-session.md
