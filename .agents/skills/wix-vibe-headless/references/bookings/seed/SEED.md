# Bookings — seeding

Seed a Wix Bookings catalog by **calling `seed-bookings.cjs`** — don't hand-write the REST calls.
It's a build-time module (run via `exec_tool`, not shipped in the app) that abstracts every Wix
Bookings seed operation. Load it and call **`setupBookings` — the one-call path** — with plain data.

> **Transcribed from `wix-headless/references/inline-recipes/setup-bookings.md` — NOT yet live-verified.**

```js
// build-time exec_tool
const { accessToken } = await base44.asServiceRole.connectors.getConnection("wix");
const seed = require(require("path").resolve(".agents/skills/wix-vibe-headless/references/bookings/seed/seed-bookings.cjs"));
const ctx = { token: accessToken, siteId: WIX_METASITE_ID };

// ONE call: install → resolve staff → categories → services → CLASS sessions → images, all in the
// correct order with ids kept in memory (no hand-threading of scheduleId/resourceId). `category` is
// a NAME (resolved to an id internally). Free service: set free:true, omit price. CLASS `sessions`
// are local "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss".
const result = await seed.setupBookings(ctx, {
  services: [
    // `imageUrl` per service is optional and attached IN this one call. Pass a plain url — the module
    // imports it into Wix Media for you (bookings binds a service image by the Wix Media file id, not a
    // url). Use the FINAL https://media.base44.com/... url from the COMPLETED generate_image (it runs in
    // the background while you build — wait for it), never a still-generating /__generating__/<id>.png.
    { type: "APPOINTMENT", name: "Consultation", description: "…", tagLine: "…", price: 75, duration: 60, category: "Our Services", imageUrl: "https://media.base44.com/…" },
    { type: "CLASS", name: "Morning Yoga", description: "…", price: 20, capacity: 20, category: "Our Services",
      sessions: [{ start: "2026-08-10T09:00:00", end: "2026-08-10T10:00:00" }] },
  ],
  // staffResourceId defaults to the fresh install's owner (queryStaff()[0].resourceId).
});
// result: { services:[...], categories:[{id,name}], resourceId, sessionsScheduled, imagesAttached }

// fallback (finer control / re-attach): import the url to Wix Media, then patch one service after the fact.
// const file = await seed.importImage(ctx, imageUrl);   // → { id, url } (Wix Media file id + wixstatic url)
// await seed.attachServiceImage(ctx, { serviceId: s.id, revision: s.revision, image: { id: file.id, url: file.url, width: 1024, height: 1024 } });
```

**Seeding is additive — never delete or overwrite existing content.** Don't clean up, don't remove
"sample" data, don't reset. Just add.

## What the shipped UI renders from this

Pass these and the catalog reads like a real one; omit them and the pages have visible holes:

- **`sessions` on every CLASS.** A class's bookable times ARE its sessions, so a class seeded without
  them shows "No available times in this range" — which reads as broken, not empty. Schedule a few
  weeks out. An APPOINTMENT needs none: its slots come from staff working hours, which a fresh
  install's owner already has.
- **`duration`** (APPOINTMENT, minutes) → the card's `60 min · 1-to-1` line and the DURATION cell on
  the service page. A class has no service-level duration and shows CAPACITY instead, so pass
  `capacity` there.
- **`tagLine`** → the card's second line. One line about the service, not a copy of `description`.
- **`price`**, or **`free: true`** for a no-fee service, which the UI labels "Free".

Two things this module can't set, so don't try: **varied pricing** (a "From €85" service needs
`payment.varied`) and **`conferencing`** (the UI's "Online" location label reads that flag — seeded
services all sit at the business location, which shows as "In person").

## Escape hatch — individual functions
Reach for the functions below only when the one-call `setupBookings` doesn't fit (partial re-seed,
custom staff/ordering). `setupBookings` is built from them, in this order:

```js
await seed.installBookingsApp(ctx);
const staff = await seed.queryStaffWithRetry(ctx);                   // → [{resourceId,id,name}]; polls (fresh install provisions the owner async); use resourceId, NOT id
const cats = await seed.createCategories(ctx, ["Our Services"]);    // → [{id,name}]; every service needs a categoryId
const services = await seed.createServices(ctx, [                   // → [{id,slug,revision,type,scheduleId}]
  { type: "APPOINTMENT", name: "Consultation", price: 75, duration: 60, categoryId: cats[0].id, staffMemberIds: [staff[0].resourceId] },
  { type: "CLASS", name: "Morning Yoga", price: 20, capacity: 20, categoryId: cats[0].id },
]);
// CLASS only: schedule sessions with each class's returned scheduleId (local wall-clock times)
await seed.scheduleClassSessions(ctx, [
  { scheduleId: services[1].scheduleId, resourceId: staff[0].resourceId, start: "2026-08-10T09:00:00", end: "2026-08-10T10:00:00", capacity: 20 },
]);
// images (optional): import the url to Wix Media first (bookings binds by file id), then attach.
// Use the FINAL https://media.base44.com/... url only (never a /__generating__/ placeholder).
const file = await seed.importImage(ctx, imageUrl);   // → { id, url } (Wix Media file id + wixstatic url)
await seed.attachServiceImage(ctx, { serviceId: services[0].id, revision: services[0].revision, image: { id: file.id, url: file.url, width: 1024, height: 1024 } });
```

## Functions
| fn | does |
|---|---|
| `setupBookings(ctx, {services, staffResourceId?})` | **one-call**: install → staff → categories → services → CLASS sessions → images |
| `installBookingsApp(ctx)` | install the Wix Bookings app on the site |
| `queryStaff(ctx)` | `[{resourceId,id,name}]` — one shot; use `resourceId`, not `id` |
| `queryStaffWithRetry(ctx)` | STEP 1 — same, but polls until the default owner provisions after a fresh install (avoids `MISSING_APPOINTMENT_RESOURCES`) |
| `createStaff(ctx, [{name,description}])` | create named staff → `[{resourceId,id,name}]` (omit email/phone) |
| `queryCategories(ctx)` | `[{id,name}]` — reuse a category created earlier this run |
| `createCategories(ctx, names)` | STEP 2 — every service needs a `category.id` or it's invisible → `[{id,name}]`; reuses an existing same-named category (idempotent, no dupes on re-run) |
| `createServices(ctx, services)` | STEP 3 — one bulk create (APPOINTMENT/CLASS mixed) → `[{id,slug,revision,type,scheduleId,success,error}]` |
| `scheduleClassSessions(ctx, sessions)` | STEP 4 (CLASS only) — one bulk Calendar-Events-V3 create → `[{id,success,error}]` |
| `getService(ctx, serviceId)` | fetch a service (current `revision`; confirm an image landed) |
| `importImage(ctx, url)` | import an external url into Wix Media → `{id,url}` (file id + wixstatic url); bookings binds by this file id |
| `attachServiceImage(ctx, {serviceId,revision,image})` | optional — patch `media.mainMedia`/`coverMedia` (revision-checked); `image.id` MUST be a Wix Media file id from `importImage` |

Both bulk calls report per-item `success`/`error` — retry only the failed items **once** with the
same body; don't loop and don't re-create the ones that already succeeded.

## Rentals

`seed-rentals.cjs` is the rentals half — the same transport, a different create order and payload.
Wix Rentals has no APIs of its own, so a rental is a Bookings service with rentals-specific
field values.

```js
const seed = require(require("path").resolve(".agents/skills/wix-vibe-headless/references/bookings/seed/seed-rentals.cjs"));
await seed.setupRentals(ctx, {
  resourceTypeName: "Meeting rooms",
  resources: ["Room A", "Room B"],              // parallel capacity = MORE RESOURCES
  rentals: [
    { name: "Meeting room, hourly", description: "…", price: 25, unit: "HOUR", min: 60, max: 480 },
    { name: "Meeting room, daily",  description: "…", price: 180, unit: "DAY", min: 1, max: 5 },
  ],
});
// → { resourceType, resources, services, ok, problems }
```

`price` is a RATE — per hour or per day — not the cost of a rental.
Hourly `min`/`max` are MINUTES (30–1440); daily are DAYS (1–8).

**`ok` must be true.** `problems` is the read-back check: a service created without `appId` or
without `durationRange` still returns 200 and is simply a plain Bookings service from then on.

### The four traps this seed handles

- **Install Rentals ONLY.** It provisions the Bookings infrastructure it runs on; installing
  Wix Bookings as well is redundant.
- **`appId` is immutable after create.** A service created without it is a plain Bookings
  service forever — there is no update that converts it.
- **Order is load-bearing: resource type → resources → services.** A service whose resource
  type holds no resources has permanently empty availability, and nothing errors.
- **Rental services do not use categories.** Unlike bookings, do not create or assign one.
- **`serviceResources` is required** and the docs' Create Service parameter list omits it.
  Without it the create fails `MISSING_APPOINTMENT_RESOURCES`, whose message sends you to check
  the resource type's contents — a dead end, since it fails even when the type is populated.

Resources are seeded **24/7** (no working hours) so a multi-day rental stays one booking rather
than a multi-service group. Pass `workingHours` only when the brief names opening hours.

## Reference
If a call returns a shape you didn't expect, or you need an operation this module doesn't cover,
use the documentation skill available in your environment to search + read the live Wix API reference — never guess. The
authoritative source recipe is `wix-headless/references/inline-recipes/setup-bookings.md`.

Read a method's page before writing its call: it carries the exact body shape, the required
permission scope, and the response envelope.
