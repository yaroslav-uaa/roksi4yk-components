# Forms — seeding (Form Schemas v4 REST)

**Two actions live in this doc — decide which one you're doing before reading on.** Both are
**admin/build-time** work over an elevated credential, and both run through the same six steps:

| action | when | the steps it uses |
|---|---|---|
| **CREATE a form** — `POST` | there's no form yet: the app needs a contact / quote / application form and nothing has been created for it | all six, in order |
| **REVISE a form** — `PATCH` | the form already exists and a request changes **what it collects**: *"add a dropdown for job industry"*, *"make the phone optional"*, *"add a file upload"*, *"drop the budget question"* | 1 (auth) → 3 (author just the new field) → **4b · Revising a form later** → 5 (re-verify) → 6 (rewrite the config, then wire the control) |

A field the visitor can fill that isn't in the schema is **silent data loss** — no submission, no
inbox, no contact, and the submit still resolves `true`. So never local component state, and never
delete-and-recreate a live form: **`PATCH` it**, keeping the `formId` the UI already imports.

The six steps, each with a section below:

1. **Authenticate** — get an elevated credential; the public client ID cannot write.
2. **Install the Wix Forms app** — idempotent, and nothing works until it's there. *(create only.)*
3. **Author the form body** — adapt the every-field payload to what the request asks for.
4. **Create the form** — POST each body; a `200` here means almost nothing. *(revising: **4b**.)*
5. **Verify it works** — read the form back, and **submit to it once** for real.
6. **Hand off** — the verified `formId` + field `target`s are written to a file the UI imports.

## API reference

Wix Forms is a **CRM** API, not Business Solutions. Read the page before writing a call you don't
find here — never guess a shape. For anything these pages don't settle — a response shape you didn't
expect, or an operation this doc doesn't cover — use the documentation skill available in your environment to search + read the
live Wix API reference.

| step | title | page | what it settles |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | About Form Fields | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas/about-form-fields.md | every field-level rule: the identifier/inputType/componentType table, validation, choice fields, contact mapping, layout |
| 3 | Create Form | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas/create-form.md | the create call, plus 10 complete request examples — the source of the payload below |
| 3 | Form object | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas/form-object.md | each property individually, incl. form-level settings this doc doesn't cover |
| 4 | Form Schemas API | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas.md | every schema method (get, list, delete, enable/disable) |
| 4b | Update Form | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas/update-form.md | the `PATCH`: revising a form without losing its `formId`, and the whole-array replace semantics |
| 4 | List Forms Providers Configs | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas/list-forms-providers-configs.md | the Forms **app's** ceiling on fields and forms — **not** the site's plan cap, which this call cannot tell you (see step 4) |
| 5 | Create Submission | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-submissions/create-submission.md | the submission call used to prove the form accepts data |
| 5 | About Submission Values | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-submissions/about-submission-values.md | the value shape each `inputType` submits — string, array, address object, … |
| 5 | Validation errors | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-submissions/introduction.md#validation-errors | what a rejected submission is telling you |
| — | Form Submissions API | https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-submissions.md | every submission method, incl. delete (used to clean up the test submission) |

**⛔ Additive only — never delete, reset, or overwrite existing forms**, even ones that look like the
install's own sample.

**⚠️ Seed BEFORE the form's UI.** Forms is the one vertical that does not run in parallel with the
client: its inputs bind to the schema's field `target`s, so nothing may be built against a form that
hasn't been created *and verified*.

## 1 · Authenticate

Every call in this doc needs an **elevated credential** — a connector/OAuth access token, or a Wix
API key. The public `WIX_CLIENT_ID` cannot write; see the platform doc's seed-auth step. There is
**no helper module** — you make each call yourself with the shapes below.

**Never inline the raw token/API key** into a command — it would end up in the transcript, exec logs,
and shell history. Keep it in a variable and reference it. On Base44 (and any exec-tool platform),
take it from the connector and call with `fetch()` rather than shelling out to curl:

```js
const { accessToken } = await base44.asServiceRole.connectors.getConnection("wix"); // stays in memory
```

On any other platform, load it into an env var from your secret manager and don't echo it. Either
way, every call below sends the same three **standard headers** — referred to as such from here on:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>     // a Wix API key goes in RAW, with no "Bearer"
wix-site-id:   <METASITE_ID>
Content-Type:  application/json
```

## 2 · Install the Wix Forms app

```
POST https://www.wixapis.com/apps-installer-service/v1/app-instance/install
{
  "tenant":      { "tenantType": "SITE", "id": "<METASITE_ID>" },
  "appInstance": { "appDefId": "225dd912-7dea-4738-8688-4b8c6955ffc2", "enabled": true }
}
```

`225dd912-7dea-4738-8688-4b8c6955ffc2` is the Wix Forms app. Until it is installed **every** Form
Schemas call fails with `UNSUPPORTED_FORM_NAMESPACE`, so run this before step 4. The call is
idempotent — re-installing returns `200` — and Base44 sites often don't have the app, so re-running
costs nothing.

## 3 · Author the form body — every field type

There is **one** create call:
`POST https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms` with
`{ "form": { "namespace": "wix.form_app.form", … } }` — that namespace is the Wix Forms app's, and
the only one the owner's dashboard shows. **You author that body**, starting from the payload below
and adapting it to the request.

The payload is one form holding **every field type Wix Forms supports**. Each field block is copied
verbatim from the official Create Form examples, so the `identifier` / `inputType` / `componentType`
triple, the options objects and the validation shapes are the ones Wix actually accepts. (Two
exceptions: **Donation** comes from About Form Fields, and **Custom price** is the one field with no
shipped example — it is composed from the property reference.)

*(Authoring side: which JSON creates each field. The rendering side — which control each one wants
and what its value looks like — is the matching table in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`; they join on
`identifier`.)*

| field                             | `identifier`            | `inputType`  | `componentType`           | submits | requires            |

\* A display field sets `fieldType: "DISPLAY"` and has neither an input type nor a
component type — the value shown is its `displayOptions.displayFieldType`.

### **Non-negotiable** rules for adapting the payload

Change the fields, labels, options and targets freely — these seven rules **must** still hold in
whatever you send. Break one and the create still returns `200`; the damage shows up in the
owner's dashboard, or on the first real submission.

- **Every `id` is a lowercase UUID v4, unique within the form** — generate it for each field and every choice `option`.
  Then use those UUIDs where reference to a field or an option is required.
- Use only **form.formFields** for fields, **never `form.fields` - that's legacy API**
- **`steps` must reference every field, including the `SUBMIT_BUTTON`.** Field that is not referenced in any 
  step will not be visible in the business manager.
- **`required` lives at `inputOptions.required`**, never inside a validation block.
- **`validation` is always present**, even as `{}`, and nests under the **`inputType`** options
  object — not the `componentType` one.
- **A choice field's `identifier` IS its kind** — `DROPDOWN`, `RADIO_GROUP`, `CHECKBOX_GROUP`,
  `TAGS` — matching the `componentType`, never `TEXT_INPUT`: the identifier routes the field to its
  renderer, so `TEXT_INPUT` + `componentType: DROPDOWN` is accepted and stored as a text input. (A
  long answer is `TEXT_AREA` for the same reason.)
- **A choice field declares its options twice** — the component's `options[]` and the validation
  `enum` (`STRING`) or `items.stringOptions.enum` + `itemType` (`ARRAY`) — and the two must agree.
  Get it wrong and the create still returns `200`: the field is created as a **plain text box**,
  losing its choices. Only the 5a component check catches it.
- **A choice field that came back as a text box: read which options block came home.**
  `textInputOptions` where you sent `dropdownOptions` is that fallback — and with a well-formed block
  and `enum`, the cause is the `identifier`. Re-sending it, or delete-and-re-add with the same
  identifier, reproduces it.
- **`target` is the immutable submission key**: starts with an ASCII letter, letters/digits/`_`
  only, no `__`, unique within the form. Use field's label converted to snake_case with _ and 6 random alphanumeric  
  characters as the field target, e.g. "First name" -> `first_name_a689be`.

## 4 · Create the form

One POST per form body, to the **Form Schemas v4** endpoint — a **CRM** API, not Business Solutions,
always on the public host, never `/_api/`:

```
POST https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms
{ "form": { "namespace": "wix.form_app.form", … the rest of the body from step 3 … } }
```

Read **`form.id`** from the response — that's the `formId` the rest of the run carries. **Record it
the moment it comes back**, before anything else: it is the only way a later attempt can tell a form
this run created from one the owner already had. Forms are independent (no shared revision), so
create them in any order.

**Three things to check before you POST.** The API accepts the first two and loses the field; the
third leaves you with a second form:

- the body has at least one `INPUT` field — a form of nothing but a submit button collects nothing;
- **no two fields share a `target`**. The server keeps one; every other field with that key silently
  stores nothing.
- **no form of this name exists yet** —
  `GET https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms?namespace=wix.form_app.form`, comparing
  `name` exactly. Wix does **not** reject a duplicate name; it silently appends a counter (`"Contact"`
  → `"Contact 1"`), so create is **not idempotent** and nothing tells you a retry duplicated a form.
  A name matching a form **this run** created (per the id you recorded above) → reuse that `formId`
  rather than creating again. A name you have no record of creating is the **owner's**: additive
  only, so leave it alone and pick a different name or ask.

An orphan *you* created in this run is yours to clear — `DELETE .../v4/forms/<formId>` is a soft
delete to the trash bin, so it is recoverable. Anything you did not create stays untouched.

**A `200` here proves almost nothing.** Most mistakes in a form body are accepted at create and
surface only in the owner's dashboard or on the first real submission — step 5 is what actually
proves the form works. Two failures worth recognizing before you retry:

- A transient `5xx`, an identity/propagation error right after install, or a timeout leaves you not
  knowing whether the create landed. **Re-list by name before retrying** — never blind-retry the
  POST, because the duplicate it may create is silent. One retry once the list comes back empty;
  never a loop.
- **Plan gates are a hard block, not a note-and-continue.** `FIELDS_COUNT_RESTRICTIONS_ERROR`
  (per-form field cap), `FILE_UPLOAD_RESTRICTIONS_ERROR` (upload/signature/payment below Core) and
  `FORMS_COUNT_RESTRICTIONS_ERROR` (site form cap) each mean **reduce or upgrade** — put the choice
  to the user with their dashboard link and wait for an answer. Never split a form across schemas to
  dodge the field cap, never inline a file as base64, and never create throwaway forms to probe the
  shape.

  **The field cap cannot be read in advance.** `listFormsProvidersConfigs` reports the Forms app's
  ceiling, not the site's plan cap — on a free site it returns `maxFields: 150` while the create is
  rejected with `"Field count reached its limit of 10"`. The cap is per plan, not per app. Treat the
  create as the only authority on the number: budget conservatively while authoring step 3 rather
  than discovering the limit after a full authoring pass, and count every entry in `formFields`, the
  `SUBMIT_BUTTON` included.

## 4b · Revising a form later

Add a field, relabel one, tighten a rule, retire one — a `PATCH`, never a second create. Everything
above still applies; this is the delta.

**Read the form back first — you need its `revision`.** The `formId` comes from
`src/rest/wix-forms.config.js` (`WIX_FORMS.<key>.formId`), never typed by hand:

```
GET https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms?namespace=wix.form_app.form&formIds=<formId>
PATCH https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms/<formId>
{ "form": { …the whole object you just read, with your change…, "revision": "<its current revision>" } }
```

- **`namespace` is a required query parameter on the read**, hence the `?namespace=` above. Without it
  the read `400`s with `namespace has size 0, expected 10 or more` — a violation naming a *field*, so
  it reads like a body problem. Fix the call, not the payload.
- **The read-back is the `PATCH` body.** Apply the change to what the `GET` returned and send that.
  `namespace` is immutable and travels along; **there is no `fieldMask`**, and no `revision` outside
  `form`. Inventing either is a silent partial write.
- **`formFields` replaces wholesale.** Wix: *"Any field that's missing from the array you send is
  moved to `deletedFormFields`, so resend every field you want to keep."* `steps` behaves the same
  way. Drops are recoverable from `deletedFormFields` — if you notice, which is step 5's job.
- **A stale `revision` is rejected** — re-`GET` and re-apply; never guess or increment it.
- **A new field needs three things generated**: a fresh UUID `id`, a `target` unique in the form
  (`job_industry_7f2b`), and — for a choice field — an options block whose `enum` and `options[]`
  agree. Step 3 is the shape, and its warnings still hold.

**Add the layout item too** — append to `steps[<n>].layout.large.items`, mirroring into `medium` /
`small` if the form has them:

```json
{ "fieldId": "<the new field's id>", "row": <next row>, "column": 0, "width": 12, "height": 1 }
```

A field missing from the layout isn't dropped, but it sorts last and has no defined position in the
owner's builder. To place it mid-form, insert at that `row` and bump every item at or after it — `row`
restarts at 0 per step.

**Changing a field's component type in place** — a text input that should have been a dropdown — means
the choice `identifier` and **only** the new options block; don't leave `textInputOptions` beside
`dropdownOptions`. A read-back still showing `textInputOptions` is the identifier, not the block.

**The other revisions:**

- **label, placeholder, options, validation, order** — patch and stop. The client reads all of those
  live from the schema, so no config rewrite and no code change follows.
- **retiring a field the form has submissions for** — set `hidden: true` ("hidden from submitters":
  the field stops being rendered, and the submissions already collected under it keep their meaning)
  rather than dropping it from the array. Drop only a field added by mistake in this same run.
- **never rename a `target`** — it's the storage key, so a rename orphans every submission already
  collected under the old one. Change the *label* instead.

**Then re-run step 5 in full** — a `PATCH` regresses a form exactly as a create does, and §5a is where
a dropdown that silently became a text input gets caught. Then step 6, revising: add the read-back
`target` to `src/rest/wix-forms.config.js` (the one sanctioned edit to that file outside a seed run,
and only *after* step 5 passes) and wire the control per `INSTRUCTIONS.md`. The field is live for new
submissions; past ones don't carry it. Step 4's plan gates apply to an added field too.

## 5 · Verify it works

**All four calls are yours to make**, and the last one needs a submission you compose from *this*
form's schema. All four use the standard headers from step 1.

**A `200` on create means the body parsed — nothing more.** Every mistake below returns `200` and
surfaces only in the owner's dashboard or on the first real submission.

### 5a · Read the form back

```
GET https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms?namespace=wix.form_app.form&formIds=<formId>
```

`formIds` narrows the listing to exactly what you created, so you assert against it directly. Then,
against the returned `form.formFields`:

- **Every `target` you sent is there.** One that isn't means the field didn't persist — usually an
  `identifier` Wix doesn't recognize, which is dropped without an error.
- **Every `inputOptions.required` reads back as you sent it.** A `required` key placed inside a
  validation block is accepted and then discarded, so the form ships with nothing mandatory. This
  diff is the only signal you will ever get.
- **Every choice field is still a choice field.** For each `DROPDOWN` / `RADIO_GROUP` /
  `CHECKBOX_GROUP` / `TAGS` you sent, assert the read-back still carries that `componentType`, that
  its `options[]` is non-empty, and that it agrees with the validation `enum`. A malformed options
  block is accepted at create and comes back as a plain text input — `target` intact, `required`
  intact — so every other check in step 5 passes and the field silently loses its choices.
- **Keep the read-back `target`s.** These, not the ones you authored, are what goes into step 6.

### 5b · Check the dashboard view

```
GET https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms/<formId>/summary
```

*(The summary and the single-form `GET` take the id in the path, so neither needs the `namespace`
query parameter — every **listing** read does.)*

Assert `formSummary.fields` is **non-empty**, with one entry per input field you sent (everything in
`formFields` except the `SUBMIT_BUTTON`). The summary is exactly what the Wix dashboard renders, so a
short or empty count means the form is blank — or partly blank — **for the owner**, even while the
public site submits fine. Non-contact fields count too; don't expect only the contact-mapped ones.

### 5c · Submit to it once, for real

This is the check the other two can't stand in for. An ARRAY field whose `validation.items` is
missing `itemType` passes 5a and 5b and then `400`s **form-wide** — every field, every visitor.
Submitting once is the only proof the form can receive data at all.

**What it does not catch:** a STRING choice field does **not** enforce its `validation.enum` on
submit. A dropdown whose enum and options both read back correctly still accepts `"Not an option"`
with a `200`. So the probe proves the form *receives* data; it will not tell you a choice field's
two declarations have drifted apart. Get those right in step 3 — nothing downstream will catch it
for you.

```
POST https://www.wixapis.com/form-submission-service/v4/submissions
{ "submission": { "formId": "<formId>", "submissions": { "<target>": <value> } } }
```

**Rules for composing `submissions`** — get one wrong and the whole submission fails, not just that
value:

- **Keys are field `target`s from the 5a read-back.** Never a label, never a field `id`. A key that
  isn't a target in the schema fails the entire submission.
- **Include every `required` field** — the server rejects the submission without them — **plus every
  ARRAY field whether required or not**, since the ARRAY shape is the thing you're testing.
- **The value's shape follows the field's `inputType`, not its component:**

  | `inputType` | value | example |
  |---|---|---|
  | `STRING` | a string, formatted per `validation.format` | `"seed-probe@example.com"`, `"2030-01-01"`, `"10:00:00"` |
  | `NUMBER` | a number | `1` |
  | `BOOLEAN` | a boolean | `true` |
  | `ARRAY` | an array of **option values** | `["Option 1"]` |
  | `ADDRESS` | an object, only the subfields the form shows | `{"country":"US","subdivision":"US-NY","city":"New York","postalCode":"10011","addressLine":"235 West 23rd Street"}` |
  | `PAYMENT` | an array of `{productId, price, quantity}` | `[{"productId":"<from validation.products>","price":"25","quantity":1}]` |
  | `SCHEDULING` | `{startDate, endDate, timeZone}` | `{"startDate":"2030-07-02T14:00:00","endDate":"2030-07-02T14:30:00","timeZone":"America/New_York"}` |

- **Use one of the field's own option `value`s** — copy it from the schema rather than retyping the
  label. The server won't reject a value outside the enum (see above), so a typo here quietly proves
  nothing.
- **`country` and `subdivision` are validated against each other**, so send a matching pair or omit
  `subdivision`.
- **A `WIX_FILE` field can't be faked.** If a file upload or signature is `required`, this check
  can't run — say so and have the user submit once through the published site instead of recording a
  pass that never happened.

Assert `200`. A **`400 SUBMISSION_VALIDATION` is a schema bug, not a submission bug** — fix the form
body and re-create it; never bend the value to get through. The error names the field and the reason
under `details.validationError.fieldViolations[].data.errors[]`, each with an `errorPath` (the
`target`) and an `errorType` — `UNKNOWN_VALUE_ERROR` means the key isn't a `target` in this form.

### 5d · Delete the test submission

```
DELETE https://www.wixapis.com/form-submission-service/v4/submissions/<id>
```

The id comes from the 5c response as **`submission.id`**: REST returns `id`, not the `_id` the
reference schema shows (that's the SDK's shape). Do this every time — the owner's inbox is a real
business inbox, and a probe left in it looks like a real enquiry. If a probe ever escapes, find it
with `POST /form-submission-service/v4/submissions/namespace/query`, filtered by `formId` and
`"namespace": "wix.form_app.form"`.

## 6 · Hand off

Only once step 5 has passed for every form, write `src/rest/wix-forms.config.js` — one entry per
form, keyed by the form's name lowercased with each run of non-alphanumerics collapsed to a single
`_` (`"Quote request"` → `quote_request`):

```js
// Written by the seed run once step 5 passed. Do not create it early: its existence is what proves
// the form schemas were created AND verified. Its only later edit is a verified schema change —
// see step 4b; never a hand-typed field.
export const WIX_FORMS = {
  contact: { formId: "…", name: "Contact", targets: { email: true, message: true } },
};
```

**That file is the handoff, and the gate.** The UI imports `WIX_FORMS` from it; no file means the
seed did not succeed, so nothing may be built against the form yet. So **never write it before step 5
passes**, and never invent a `formId`. If the app's `src/` layout puts its REST layer elsewhere, write
it there instead — the path matters less than the file existing before the UI step.

`targets` is the **read-back** map of immutable submission keys — the one from 5a, not the one you
authored in step 3. Everything else — labels, order, options, validation — the client reads **live
from the schema**, so an owner's dashboard edit shows on the site with no code change.
