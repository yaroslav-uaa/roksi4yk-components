# Members — seeding

**Nothing to seed.** Members login is the identity layer: members **self-register** through the
Wix login page, so there is no member to create at build time and nothing lands in a `seeded`
map. There is intentionally no `seed-*.cjs` here.

The members work is entirely **frontend wiring** (custom login, account area, gated content) —
see this vertical's `INSTRUCTIONS.md` and the reference components.

_Optional, off by default:_ only if a run's prompt explicitly asks to exercise the pricing-plans
purchase path end-to-end, one test member may be created — keep this off so headless runs stay
deterministic and don't stall on an interactive login. If you need that, use the documentation skill available in your environment for the current member-create shape (source: `wix-headless/references/SEED.md` § members).

## Reference
Members self-register, so this vertical seeds nothing. These are the methods to read if you do reach
for one — each page carries the exact body shape, the required permission scope, and the response
envelope. `Create Member` needs an elevated credential; the rest run from the client.
