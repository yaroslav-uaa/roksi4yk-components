## This app — a Wix-managed headless frontend (built with the Wix skills)

This project is the **frontend for a Wix-managed business** — a REST client that talks directly to a live Wix site over \`WIX_CLIENT_ID\`. The **Wix site is the source of truth** for all content and commerce; build and seed it only through the Wix connector and the skills below. **Do NOT use the Base44 commerce kit (or any Base44 solution kit).**

The Wix skills live under \`.agents/skills/\` — on ANY turn, read them from that exact path (ignore stray copies like \`agent/skills/\`).

- \`wix-vibe-headless\` — **how the CLIENT is built AND how the site is seeded**: your vertical's UI client + REST scaffolds are already deployed into \`src/\`; one vertical per capability under \`references/<vertical>/\`, each with a \`seed/\` module that creates content over the connector:
  - **storefront** — sell physical or digital products online.
  - **bookings** — let customers book appointments or services with your business.
  - **blog** — publish articles for visitors to read.
  - **forms** — any visitor-fillable form: contact/enquiry, lead, signup, waitlist, application, feedback/survey, quote request, intake or registration. **Not forms** — an event or occasion RSVP is **events** (built-in RSVP registration form), and a per-service booking form is **bookings**.
  - **cms** — model and serve your own custom, structured content — for anything the other verticals don't cover. **Not cms** — a visitor-fillable form is **forms**; reach for cms only when the app must read the entries back.
  - **portfolio** — showcase creative work in collections and project pages.
  - **pricing-plans** — sell memberships or subscriptions to your service.
  - **events** — publish events and handle RSVPs or ticket sales.
  - **members** — let visitors create an account and sign in — this is **auth**.
  - **restaurants** — publish a menu, take online orders, and manage table reservations.
- **Documentation fallback** for **frontend code**, **backend code**, or **runtime / API management operations** alike: consult the official Wix API documentation using the documentation skill available in your environment.
