// Post-install deploy — run by base44.md STEP 1 with the vertical(s) the app needs:
//   node deploy.cjs <vertical> [<vertical> …] --client-id <id> --metasite-id <id>
//   (storefront | bookings | blog | cms | forms | portfolio | pricing-plans | events | members | restaurants)
// Pass the two ids from the prompt and this writes src/rest/wix-config.js for you — see WRITE below.
// Retyping those ids into the file by hand is how a storefront ships with a dead client id.
// ONE mechanism: recursively copy `app/` -> /app/src. The shared transport (app/rest/wix-client.js,
// wix-config.js) is copied always; then each named vertical's app/ (its UI + app/rest/ helpers).
// Deploy every vertical the app actually uses, in one call or across several — an app that needs both
// members and cms names both, and its CMS helpers then come from the skill instead of being
// hand-written. Order matters only where two verticals ship a file at the SAME path (both have
// components/…, pages/…): the first one listed wins, since the copy never overwrites. Verticals whose
// file sets don't overlap (cms and forms ship utils only, no UI) combine freely.
// paths are the Base44 sandbox's /app. Re-running is non-destructive: it fills in only missing files,
// never overwriting the agent's edits (see COPY), so a later call can add a vertical safely.
// No vertical arg -> deploys just the shared transport; re-run with the vertical(s) once known.
// NOTE: .cjs on purpose — the app is an ESM package ("type":"module"); a .js here would load as ESM
// and require()/module.exports would throw.

// Base44 seeds src/pages/Login.jsx + src/pages/Register.jsx into every custom-auth-enrolled app
// at APP CREATION, before any Wix skill ever runs (backend/app/user_apps/auth_templates/_loader.py
// in the platform repo). The members vertical's own Login.jsx lands at that SAME path via the COPY
// above, but COPY's force:false skips it because Base44's file is already there — so the Base44-auth
// page silently survives instead of the Wix-auth one, and the app ends up with two half-wired auth
// systems. There is no Wix Register.jsx at all (LoginForm's own "Sign up" tab covers registration),
// so Base44's Register.jsx was never even in contention — it just sits there, wrong, either way.
//
// Fix both, but ONLY when the file currently on disk is still recognizably Base44's boilerplate
// (imports base44Client / calls base44.auth.*). Never touch a file that's already the Wix version
// or an agent's own customization — same "don't clobber" contract as COPY above, just evaluated on
// content instead of mere existence.

// at app creation (Base44) has each id as an exact value rather than a copy read out of a prompt.

// This briefly worked the other way round for WIX_METASITE_ID, while Base44 could write a different
