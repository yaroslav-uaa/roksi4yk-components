# Building on Wix from Base44

The Wix connector is connected; this is how the app gets built on it — gather the site's context,
find the APIs and learn their contracts from the docs, write the code. **Discover everything**: endpoints, paths, doc URLs,
request and response fields all come from the calls below, never from memory or pattern. 404 or
empty ⇒ discover, not permute. Examples teach mechanics and go stale — verify before relying.

**Start every Wix task by getting the site context** (`wx.context`, below). It reports what the
site actually has and how each part is configured, so every call targets what is really there
instead of a guess from a name. It is the first step of a task, not a one-time setup: a later turn
does not inherit an earlier turn's context, so re-read it before building on or calling a Wix API.

**A management or admin task starts at the recipes**: call `wx.mgmtRecipes` (Learn Wix) and follow
the one that fits. A recipe states outright what an API does not support, which fields a bulk call
actually writes, and the order two calls have to go in — from the schemas alone those get re-derived
several errors at a time. `wx.search` ranks the matching recipes too (recipe entries in `hits`), so
they also surface from a search that began at the methods.

In this skill:

- **What are you building?** — route each feature to its identity: visitor token, admin token
  in a backend function, or admin ad hoc in exec_tool
- **The helpers** — the `wx.*` loader every exec opens with
- **Gather context** — `wx.context`, the report of what the site actually has
- **Learn Wix** — find the APIs, learn their contracts
  - **Management recipes** — first stop for an admin task (`wx.mgmtRecipes`)
  - **Search and browse** — `wx.search` across methods, recipes and articles
  - **Read a doc page** — `wx.page` for a located doc URL
  - **The spec index** — `wx.spec`, a located method's exact schema
- **Write the code**
  - **Admin ops while building** — you, in exec_tool
  - **Backend functions** — the app, as the owner
  - **Visitor authentication and Wix-hosted flows** — the visitor client, redirect sessions,
    the headless OAuth app — and bootstrapping a whole vertical with `wix-vibe-headless`

## What are you building?

Choose the token by who the code acts for. A headless app can serve visitors, provide admin
management tools, or do both.

**A site for visitors** — use a visitor token for public reads and actions on behalf of the
visitor, never the admin connector token. Call Wix directly from the browser through one shared
visitor client (Write the code, below). Redirect sessions for Wix-hosted flows also require a
visitor token minted for the headless OAuth app; see Visitor authentication and Wix-hosted flows below.
Anyone can mint an anonymous visitor token from the
OAuth app's public `clientId`; no visitor login is required. APIs for the "current visitor"
use that token to identify whose data and state to access. This applies both to a standalone
headless frontend and to a frontend extending an existing Wix site.

**An admin tool for the owner** — use the admin connector token in backend functions implementing
admin logic; keep it secret and server-side. The frontend calls those functions, not Wix with
visitor tokens. A custom headless management site extending the Wix back office follows this
flow too. Ad hoc management calls in `exec_tool` also use the admin token. Backend functions
also handle work requiring the owner's permissions, such as webhooks, scheduled jobs, and
explicitly authorized elevated operations. For an app with both visitor and admin features,
keep each feature on its corresponding flow.

```
visitor pages ──(visitor token)────────────────────────► wixapis.com
admin pages   ──► base44/functions/… ──(admin token)────► wixapis.com
exec_tool     ──(admin token, ad hoc management)────────► wixapis.com
```

## The helpers

Research and probing run in exec_tool, and one loader opens every exec (execs share no state —
reload each round; the module lives on disk next to this file, network only as first-touch
fallback):

```js
const fs = require("fs"), P = ".agents/skills/wix-base44-connector/utils.cjs";
if (!fs.existsSync(P)) { fs.mkdirSync(".agents/skills/wix-base44-connector", { recursive: true });
  fs.writeFileSync(P, await (await fetch("https://www.wix.com/skills/wix-base44-connector/scripts/utils.cjs")).text()); }
const wx = require(require("path").resolve(P));
```

`wx` exports these helpers:

- `wx.post/get/patch/put/del(url, [body], token?)` — JSON transports, one per verb (`get`/`del` take no body): Bearer from `token`, non-2xx **throws** the API's own error
- `wx.clip(value)` — cap a return value: oversized → `{ truncated, total, head }`; renders `undefined` as `null` so absence stays visible
- `wx.context(token)` — the site's full dynamic context report; inline when small, otherwise a saved Markdown file with a heading outline
- `wx.browse(menuUrl, { include, filter, depth })` — walk a docs-portal menu deterministically
- `wx.search(term, { type, max, lines })` — ranked REST docs, Headless articles, and management recipes in one `hits` list; see the response type under Search and browse. Only method hits carry an endpoint.
- `wx.page(docsUrl)` — read a doc page; its worked examples come back as titles + line numbers
- `wx.bash(cmd)` — shell over saved files (GNU grep/sed; awk is mawk; no rg)
- `wx.spec(docsUrl | code)` — a method's exact schema, plus the titles of the docs' own request examples saved at `examplesPath`; pass a hit's docsUrl (direct load), or raw code to query the index yourself
- `wx.mgmtRecipes(q?)` — management-recipe index; no arg → categories, a word → matching recipes
- `wx.installApp(appDefId, siteId, token)` — install a Wix app on the site (Apps Installer). If discovery finds an API whose app isn't installed on the site, install it first — that's a one-call prerequisite, **not** a reason to fall back to a hand-built alternative. `appDefId` from `search` or the Apps-Created-by-Wix table; `siteId` from `context` (the site report)

Search makes one combined request across REST, management recipes, and Headless by default.
The service ranks them together and interleaves methods and articles; the helper preserves that
order. `max` limits the combined result count (default 15).

Every helper answers inline when the result fits (≤ 4,000 chars — exec results clip at ~5,000).
A bigger result is saved under `.agents/skills/wix-base44-connector/tmp/` and comes back as
`{ path, bytes, lines, outline }` — the outline is your map into the file. Work a saved file in
two moves: find with `wx.bash("grep -n 'term' <path> | head -40")` (or across every save:
`grep -rn 'term' .agents/skills/wix-base44-connector/tmp/`), then quote with `read_file` — an
`offset`/`limit` window at the lines grep named, or the whole file when it fits the 45K cap.

## Gather context — the dynamic context report

```js
const { accessToken } = await base44.asServiceRole.connectors.getConnection("wix");
return await wx.context(accessToken);
```

One report: installed apps **with ids** (incl. Stores' catalog version — V1 vs V3 decides its
endpoints), the OAuth app id (**also the visitor `clientId`**), locale, currency, CMS collections.
An empty report = bad token, never an empty site.

Reports over 4,000 characters are saved in full to a temporary Markdown file. The result includes
its path, byte and line counts, and a heading outline. Read that file to inspect the site context.

## Learn Wix — find the APIs, learn their contracts

### Management recipes — first stop for an admin task

Curated admin flows, by category — ecommerce, bookings, stores, cms, google-ads, sites, contacts,
get-paid, marketing, pricing-plans, events, blog, forms, restaurants, domains, media, …:

```js
await wx.mgmtRecipes();           // categories with counts
await wx.mgmtRecipes("stores");   // a category's list — or any task word: wx.mgmtRecipes("coupon")
// each row points at its recipe: `file` when the wix-manage skill is installed — read_file it
// straight off disk — else `url`: wx.page(url), whole when small, saved + outline when big
```

A recipe carries prerequisites, order, and gotchas that no method page has. `wx.search` ranks
these same recipes in its `hits` list, so they surface either way.

### Search and browse

`wx.search` returns a saved-file reference and ranked hits. Each hit is a method,
article, or recipe, identified by its title field; only methods have an endpoint.

```ts
type Section = { title: string; line: number }; // 1-based line in the saved file
type SearchResult = {
  path: string; bytes: number; lines: number; note?: string;
  hits: ({ docsUrl: string } & (
    | { method: string; endpoint: string | null; gist?: string; examples?: Section[] }
    | { article: string | null; line: number; outline?: Section[] }
    | { recipe: string | null; line: number; lines: number;
        file?: string; steps?: string[]; calls?: string[] }
  ))[];
};
```

The file at `path` keeps the full returned Markdown, while optional details and excess
hits may be omitted from the inline response. Null titles or endpoints were not parsed.
If no result blocks parse, `head` and `note` replace `hits`; the final size-limit fallback
is `{ truncated: true, total: number, head: string }` instead of the object above.

```js
// name the method? search finds it in one call:
const result = await wx.search("stores v3 update product"); // SearchResult above
// Keep all hit kinds; only a method hit has an endpoint to call and a schema for wx.spec.
// exploring an unfamiliar product? browse is deterministic — menuUrl alone orients (children + counts);
// filter before listing methods. browse works for both portals this skill uses — REST
// (api-reference) and WIX_HEADLESS (go-headless) — just pass that portal's menu URL.
await wx.browse("https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-solutions/bookings/bookings",
                { include: ["METHOD"], filter: "resched", depth: 4 });
// non-REST portal — same call, that portal's menu URL:
await wx.browse("https://dev.wix.com/docs/go-headless/authentication", { depth: 2 });

// don't know where it lives? search ranks, never says "no match" — drop wrong-product hits
await wx.search("pause a pricing plan subscription and resume it");
// Same SearchResult: methods, articles, and recipes remain in ranked order.
```

Go deeper for fields, enums, or absence — only the spec index proves absence.

### Read a doc page

Method pages are 100 KB+, twin REST and SDK halves repeating field names at different types —
map and window in the SAME exec; coordinates are for your code, not for a second round:

```js
const pg = await wx.page(docsUrl);   // whole text when small; else { path, bytes, lines, outline }
// pg.examples lists the page's worked requests as { title, line } — a complete request (URL,
// headers, body) is usually all you need: read_file(pg.path, offset: <its line>)
// anything else, windowed to your term in the same round:
return wx.bash(`sed -n '/^## REST API/,/^## JavaScript SDK/p' ${pg.path} | grep -B5 -A40 -i 'examples\\|<term>' | head -c 3800`);
// a giant fenced example → its field vocabulary instead of paging it:
// wx.bash(`sed -n '<a>,<b>p' ${pg.path} | grep -oE '"[a-zA-Z]+":' | sort -u | head -60`)
```

`search` also saves its raw content beside the inline hits — grep its `path` when a hit's six
lines weren't enough.

### The spec index — a located method's exact schema

Pass a method's `docsUrl` (a search/browse hit carries it) — spec loads that method's schema (request
body, responses, filterable-fields map, examples) in one call, a direct lookup. Read the field
**descriptions**, not just the names — they carry the rules (which field is canonical, when one is empty):

```js
const sp = await wx.spec(hit.docsUrl);
// sp.examples — the method's worked requests as { title, line }, all saved at sp.examplesPath.
// The one that matches the task is rarely the first: read_file(sp.examplesPath, offset: <its line>)
```

Want to shape the result yourself? Pass raw code against the index (`lightIndex` + `getResourceSchemaByUrl`):

```js
await wx.spec(`
  const url = "<docsUrl from search/browse>";           // API method page, not a skill/article page
  const s = await getResourceSchemaByUrl(url);
  const m = s.methods.find(x => x.docsUrl === url);
  return {
    call: m.publicUrl,                                       // callable https://www.wixapis.com/… URL
    body: m.requestBody?.content["application/json"].schema.properties,
    responses: m.responses,
    filterable: m.queryMethodData?.queryFieldsCapabilitiesMap      // query methods
             || m.searchMethodData?.searchFieldsCapabilitiesMap,   // search methods
    example: m.legacyExamples?.[0]?.content,
  };
  // { $circular: "<name>" } types resolve via s.components.schemas["<name>"] — complete in this call
`);
```

`filterable` maps each field to its allowed operators + sort — filter server-side only on what it
lists, else filter in code.

## Write the code

**REST, not the JS SDK** — everywhere: the admin ops you run while building, backend functions,
frontend pages. Doc pages carry twin REST and SDK halves; read the REST one.

**Send what the page documents, nothing more** — required fields, nesting, and enum values exactly
as spelled; a header only when the operation's REST section lists it. Never `wix-site-id`: every
token here is already bound to a site, and in the browser the header fails CORS preflight outright.

**Shapes are discovery too**: read a method's request/response schema from `spec()` — its field
descriptions state which field is canonical and when one reads back empty. Don't infer shape from a
single live probe: it reflects only the params you sent, so probe with the same request your code makes.

### Admin ops while building — you, in exec_tool

```js
const { accessToken } = await base44.asServiceRole.connectors.getConnection("wix");
const data = await wx.post("https://www.wixapis.com/contacts/v5/contacts/query",   // spec-index publicUrl
  { query: { cursorPaging: { limit: 10 } } }, accessToken);
// let it throw — the thrown message is your result; .catch hides the answer
return wx.clip({ error: null, count: data.contacts?.length, first: data.contacts[0] });
// `first` is one complete record — read the real field shapes off it; don't code from remembered key names
```

### Backend functions — the app, as the owner

The same API call, deployed. **No helpers run here** — `wx.*` is a build tool loaded into exec,
absent from `base44/functions/…`; write plain `fetch`. Nor `clip`, which caps what an exec returns
to you: a function returns its data to the app.

```js
// inside base44/functions/… — plain fetch, no wx
const { accessToken } = await base44.asServiceRole.connectors.getConnection("wix");
const res = await fetch("https://www.wixapis.com/contacts/v5/contacts/query", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: { cursorPaging: { limit: 10 } } }),
});
if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`${res.status} ${await res.text()}`);   // the API's own error, not a generic one
return (await res.json()).contacts;
```

- That `Authorization: Bearer …` is the whole auth for this lane, unless the operation's page says
  otherwise.
- One file per business area, not per call — each file is its own deploy, and deploys cost time.
- Call every function you deploy and fix what breaks. Deploying is not testing.

### Visitor authentication and Wix-hosted flows

The "site for visitors" shape (What are you building?), in code — one file pages import. Neither
`clientId` (from the context report) nor the minted token is a secret; together they are "an
anonymous visitor", safe in shipped code:

```js
// src/lib/wixClient.js
let token;
const mint = async (body) => {
  const r = await (await fetch("https://www.wixapis.com/oauth2/token", { method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }, body: JSON.stringify(body) })).json();
  token = r.access_token; sessionStorage.setItem("wixRefresh", r.refresh_token);   // expires_in: 14400s = 4h
};
// first visit:  mint({ clientId: WIX_CLIENT_ID, grantType: "anonymous" });
// on expiry:    mint({ refreshToken: sessionStorage.getItem("wixRefresh"), grantType: "refresh_token" });
export const wix = (path, opts = {}) => fetch("https://www.wixapis.com" + path, { ...opts,
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" } });
```

If you need to test a visitor API, including redirect sessions, you can do so in `exec_tool`. Mint a visitor
token and pass it to the API call so the test uses the same identity as the visitor frontend.
Token contract: [Retrieve Tokens](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-management/headless/authentication/retrieve-tokens.md).
For example, test a public read:

```js
const { access_token: visitorToken } = await wx.post("https://www.wixapis.com/oauth2/token",
  { clientId: WIX_CLIENT_ID, grantType: "anonymous" });   // clientId: from the context report
return await wx.post("<a public read from Learn Wix>", { query: {} }, visitorToken);
// 200 ⇒ every visitor-facing page in the app is this same call, no server between
// a lean default response isn't the whole shape — contracts often define a fields param
// that opts INTO heavier parts (formatted prices, media); read the contract for it
```

**Any Wix-hosted flow that returns the visitor to your app needs the headless OAuth app's
redirect config set.** This covers redirect sessions *and* sending a buyer to the Wix-hosted
checkout `checkoutUrl` and back — any flow where Wix redirects to a URL on your app. Use the
OAuth app's `clientId` from `wx.context()`; if the report has no OAuth app, create one with the
admin connector token as shown below, then mint a visitor token from its `clientId` (anonymous
visitors do not need to log in). **Always set `allowedRedirectUris` and `allowedRedirectDomains`
when you create it** — an OAuth app created with a name only cannot complete any return, and the
break is silent (create-checkout and the anonymous token still succeed) until a real buyer is
redirected and stranded on Wix.

```js
// Register BOTH of this app's own URLs — its preview URL and its published URL — so returns work
// before AND after publish. Both are built from the Base44 app id (NOT the Wix OAuth client_id /
// appId used above):
//   preview:   https://preview-sandbox--<base44-app-id>.base44.app
//   published: https://<app-name-slug>-<last 8 of the base44-app-id>.base44.app
//              where <app-name-slug> is the app's name (the brand name) slugified — e.g.
//              "Flash Sale Spark" -> flash-sale-spark-a4615088.base44.app.
// A custom domain the owner connects overrides the published one; the app name (hence the slug)
// can also change. So prefer the app's real current published URL when you have it, and update
// this same OAuth app whenever the name or domain changes — never create another.
const appOrigins = [previewUrl, publishedUrl]; // this app's actual preview + published URLs
const loginCallbacks = appOrigins.map(origin => new URL("/login-callback", origin).href);
const returnDomains = appOrigins.map(origin => new URL(origin).hostname);

// OAuth redirect configuration: exact login URLs versus domains for other returns.
// https://dev.wix.com/docs/go-headless/authentication/setup/allow-redirect-uris-and-domains.md
const { accessToken: adminToken } = await base44.asServiceRole.connectors.getConnection("wix");
const { oAuthApp } = await wx.post("https://www.wixapis.com/oauth-app/v1/oauth-apps", {
  oAuthApp: {
    name: "My App",
    // Login callbacks: the authorization request's redirect URI must match exactly.
    allowedRedirectUris: loginCallbacks,
    // Returns from Wix-hosted flows: hostnames only, allowing URLs under each domain.
    allowedRedirectDomains: returnDomains,
  },
}, adminToken);
const clientId = oAuthApp.id; // Public visitor client ID, used by the frontend client above.

// If destinations change later, update this OAuth app rather than creating another.
// Read its existing lists and merge new entries before updating, preserving old entries.
// https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/business-management/headless/oauth-apps/update-oauth-app.md

```

Frontend redirect example, using the visitor client above after obtaining a visitor token:

```js
import { wix } from "@/lib/wixClient";

// Flow prerequisites and supported intents:
// https://dev.wix.com/docs/go-headless/business-solutions/wix-hosted-pages/redirect-using-the-rest-api.md
export async function redirectToWix(intent, returnPath = "/") {
  // wix sends the minted visitor token. Never use the admin token here.
  // Admin tokens are for ad hoc management calls or backend functions implementing admin logic.
  // Pass the intent required by the selected flow's schema.
  const response = await wix("/headless/v1/redirect-session", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      ...intent,
      callbacks: {
        postFlowUrl: new URL(returnPath, window.location.origin).href,
      },
    }),
  });
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`${response.status} ${await response.text()}`);
  const { redirectSession } = await response.json();
  window.location.assign(redirectSession.fullUrl);
}
```

**Building a whole vertical? Bootstrap it with `wix-vibe-headless`.** When the build is a
visitor-facing site on a Wix vertical it supports — a storefront, bookings, pricing plans,
events, restaurants, rentals, a blog and more — the `wix-vibe-headless` skill stands the
vertical up fast: it is built entirely on the same Wix APIs as this skill, but ships working
code (REST transport, scaffolds, UI) plus management-API abstractions (seeding,
configuration), so the vertical bootstraps on Base44 in a fraction of the calls.
Read the entry point at
[`www.wix.com/skills/wix-vibe-headless/platforms/base44.md`](https://www.wix.com/skills/wix-vibe-headless/platforms/base44.md).
Its STEP 1 carries the install itself — the verbatim `npx skills add` call to run through
exec_tool, the companion skills, the vertical table and the scaffold deploy — after which the
guide lives at `.agents/skills/wix-vibe-headless/platforms/base44.md`. Reading it as
reference alone is fine, but when you do install, go through its flow end to end — the
shipped scaffolds and seed path are most of its value.
