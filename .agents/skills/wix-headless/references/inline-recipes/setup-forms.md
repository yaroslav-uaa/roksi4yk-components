name: "Setup Forms"
description: Initializes a Wix Forms backend with Form Schemas v4 for any visitor-fillable form — contact, survey, application, waitlist or custom data capture — by cleaning the install's sample forms, creating one form schema per requested form, then verifying each renders via the form summary; revises an existing form with `PATCH` + its `revision`. Specifies the *how* (calls + format); which forms and what they collect come from the request.

**RECIPE**: Business Recipe – Initial Setup for Wix Forms (Form Schemas v4)

> **Standard call shape (every curl below).** The `<AUTH>` placeholder is shorthand for
> `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` only. Body-bearing requests also need
> `Content-Type: application/json`. Send `wix-site-id: <SITE_ID>` on every call.

A concise checklist for preparing any new Wix site that uses the **Wix Forms** app. Wix Forms backs
**any form a visitor fills in** — a contact or enquiry form, a signup or waitlist, an application, a
feedback form or survey, a quote request, an intake or registration questionnaire, or any custom data
capture. Lead capture is the most common case, not the only one: the schema is a generic
field-definition store, and whether a submission becomes a CRM contact is just the optional per-field
`contactMapping` (STEP 2). This recipe is for **initial backend setup ONLY**, not for coding the
frontend.

> **Two boundaries.** Forms does **not** own **RSVP to an event or occasion** (that is the `events`
> vertical, which ships its own registration form) or the **per-service booking form** (`bookings`).
> Route there when an event or a bookable service is involved; use `forms` for everything else.

> **This recipe is the *how*, not the *what*.** How many forms, and what each one collects, come
> from the request you're fulfilling. This recipe only specifies the calls and the request format;
> it does not decide which forms to create.

> **API surfaces:** Wix Forms is a **standalone CRM API**. A form **schema** (the field definitions)
> lives on **Form Schemas v4** at `https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms` — docs
> portal **CRM ▸ Forms ▸ Form Schemas**, *not* Business Solutions. This is **NOT** the
> events/bookings per-event registration form (a different thing). The Forms app's `appDefId` is
> `225dd912-7dea-4738-8688-4b8c6955ffc2`; an `UNSUPPORTED_FORM_NAMESPACE` error means the app isn't
> installed. Call the **public** host shown above (no `/_api/` prefix).
>
> **API reference:**
> - Create Form: <https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas/create-form> — its

## Article: Steps for Setting Up Wix Forms

**⚠️ CRITICAL ORDER REQUIREMENT: clean the install's default sample form FIRST (STEP 1), before
creating any form.** Listing-then-deleting before you create guarantees every id you delete is a
pre-existing form, never one you just created — and it keeps you clear of the site's low form cap.
**But only delete forms that are obviously the install's own default sample form:** the site may
already hold the owner's **real forms** (a connect/iterate run, or an owner-populated site). If
what's there isn't obviously install sample data, or you're unsure, **do not delete it — ask the
user first** (`SEED.md`: seeding is additive; deleting real content needs the owner's approval).

### STEP 1: Clean — remove any pre-existing (install-default) forms

A freshly installed Wix Forms app **may ship a default "Get in touch" form** (a contact form with
`first_name` / `email` / `message` fields). Its presence is **not deterministic** — some fresh
installs ship it and others don't, so it appears provisioning/timing-dependent. Rather than assume,
**list what's actually there and delete whatever comes back** — this is a safe no-op when the list
is empty.

1. **List the existing forms** —
   `GET https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms?namespace=wix.form_app.form&fieldsets=METADATA`,
   then again with `&enabled=false`. Collect every `form.id` from both responses (`forms[].id`).
2. **Delete each** — `DELETE https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms/{formId}` (one
   call per id; returns `200 {}`). Because the list ran **before** any create, every id returned is
   a pre-existing form — safe to delete. If the list was empty, issue no DELETE (a correct no-op).

**⚠️ Why clean even though it's often a no-op — the form cap.** Leftovers plus your new forms can
exhaust the site's form allowance (read it from
[List Forms Providers Configs](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas/list-forms-providers-configs)),
which is also why you must **never create throwaway forms to probe the shape.**

> **⚠️ `providers-config` tells you which namespaces the site can create in — NOT its limits.** A
> provider app declares `restrictions` **once, for all sites**, in its app dashboard; the Wix Forms
> app separately derives the site's real form/field/step limits from its **premium plan** and
> enforces them on every create. (A missing `restrictions` means default platform limits, not
> unlimited.) That is why free and unpublished sites report `maxFields: 150` / `maxForms: 150` here
> while the create rejects with `Field count reached its limit of 10` and
> `Steps count reached its limit of 3`. **The create call is the only authority** — when it returns
> a count error, go to "Plan gates" below.

### STEP 2: Create each form schema

**One POST per form** to `https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms`. How many forms, and
each form's fields and labels, come from the request you're fulfilling; this step gives the call and
the required format. Forms are independent (no shared revision), so concurrent creates are safe.

**Every body carries `"namespace": "wix.form_app.form"`** — the same literal the reads below take as
their required `?namespace=`. A form created under anything else is reachable over the API and
invisible in the dashboard and Editor.

**⚠️ Generate every `id` in the shell as a lowercase UUID v4 — never type one from memory**
(`uuidgen | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'`). Supply them at create rather than omitting them: `steps` must
reference each field by `fieldId` in the same request.

**Assemble the request** from the closest Create Form example, building each `formFields[]` entry —
including the `SUBMIT_BUTTON` — per
**[About Form Fields](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas/about-form-fields)**,
which owns every field-level rule, including placing every field in the layout — **with one
documented gap: where `required` goes (next paragraph). The guide never says, so don't infer it from
its "Validation" section.**
**Geometry (`row`/`column`/`width`) does not matter on headless** — the frontend renders its own
layout from `formFields[]` and never reads `steps[].layout` (`how-to-code-forms.md`) — so the layout
is a *correctness* requirement, not a design one: assert presence and coverage only. Use a single
step unless the request needs multiple pages.

**⚠️ `required` goes at `inputOptions.required` — NOT inside the field's `validation` block.** It sits
beside `target`/`inputType`:

```jsonc
"inputOptions": {
  "target": "first_name",
  "required": true,                                    // HERE — beside target/inputType
  "pii": true,
  "contactMapping": { "contactField": "FIRST_NAME" },  // per field; this is what creates the contact
  "inputType": "STRING",
  "stringOptions": {
    "validation": {},                                  // always present, even empty — never `required`
    "componentType": "TEXT_INPUT",
    "textInputOptions": { "label": "First name", "showLabel": true }
  }
}
```

A `required` key inside `stringOptions.validation` — or any `<inputType>Options.validation`, since no
input type's validation object defines it — is **accepted at create and then silently discarded**:
`200`, the form lists, the summary returns every field, and every field still reads back
`required: false`. The form ships publicly with nothing mandatory and **no error anywhere in the
response**, so STEP 3's read-back diff is the only signal. `validation` carries value constraints
only (`format`, `enum`, `minimum`, `minLength`, `items`). The lone exception is the multi-line address
field, whose per-subfield flags genuinely live at
`addressOptions.validation.fields.<sub>.required`.

**⚠️ Any example value you author into the schema follows the site's country, not your default.** A
`placeholder` (or label/hint) carrying a phone number, postcode, currency or date is **visible to
every visitor**, so a `+44`- or US-shaped example on a site in another market is a locale bug. Resolve
the site's country and, for an illustrative phone number, take it from that country's
regulator-reserved fictional range — the resolution order and the vetted per-country map live in
`how-to-code-forms.md` ("Validation"). Leaving a constrained field's `placeholder` empty is fine: the
frontend synthesizes the example from the field's `format` at render time.

**⚠️ A `200` proves nothing: always run STEP 3.** Most mistakes here are accepted at create and only
surface in the dashboard or on the first real submission.

#### Plan gates — surface the choice, never engineer around it

Three plan-tier limits return a real `400` on create. **Do not work around any of them; tell the user
to reduce or upgrade.**

- **Field count — two caps, counting different things.** `Field count reached its limit of N` is the
  **premium** cap the Wix Forms app enforces from the site's plan, and it counts **`INPUT` fields
  only** (display elements and the `SUBMIT_BUTTON` don't count). `FORM_FIELDS_COUNT_EXCEEDED` /
  `FIELDS_COUNT_RESTRICTIONS_ERROR` is the schema-service cap, which counts **every** field
  including display elements. **Do NOT split the form into multiple schemas** to dodge either — that
  trades one submission record for several and consumes more of the site's form allowance. Reduce
  the field count, or upgrade.
- **`Steps count reached its limit of N`** — the premium cap on `steps.length`. Collapse the form
  into fewer pages, or upgrade. Conditions (`formRules`) are capped the same way. Neither has a
  schema-service equivalent, so neither appears in the Create Form error table.
- **`FILE_UPLOAD_RESTRICTIONS_ERROR`** — a file upload, signature, or payment field on a plan below
  Core. **Do NOT suggest inlining files as base64** — it stores no real file, gives the owner nothing
  usable, and blows past submission size limits. Drop the field, or upgrade.
- **`FORMS_COUNT_RESTRICTIONS_ERROR`** / **`NAMESPACE_FORMS_COUNT_EXCEEDED`** (and
  `NAMESPACE_DELETED_FORMS_COUNT_EXCEEDED` for the trash bin) — the site hit its plan's total-form cap. Upgrade, or free a
  slot (STEP 1's list-then-delete — but only delete forms that are clearly install sample data; ask
  before deleting anything that could be the owner's real form).

**⚠️ A plan gate is a HARD BLOCK on the run — not a soft "record it and continue" precondition like
paid tickets or online reservations.** Those leave a working schema and fail only at runtime; here the
schema doesn't exist, so its `formId`/field `target`s don't either. **Put the choice to the user
(reduce, or upgrade — with the MSID + dashboard link), wait for their confirmation, then create and
verify the schema (STEP 2 → STEP 3) BEFORE any frontend work.** Do **not** build the frontend "in the
meantime": its inputs bind to those targets, so every binding would be a guess to rewrite.

Read `form.id` from the response as the `formId` to keep.

If a create fails transiently on a fresh site (`5xx`, or an identity/propagation error right after
install — the install returns `appInstance.status: "UNKNOWN"` until it propagates), retry the same
call **once**; do not loop.

### STEP 3: Verify each form persisted (mandatory)

A `200` on create is not proof the form is queryable or that the dashboard will render it.

1. **List once** —
   `GET https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms?namespace=wix.form_app.form&formIds=<id1>&formIds=<id2>`
   — **`formIds` narrows the list to exactly the forms you just created**, so you assert against them
   directly instead of filtering a whole-namespace listing. For each form, confirm its `id` appears,
   its **`formFields[]`** covers every field you sent, and its **`steps` is non-empty and places
   every field** (per About Form Fields). **Also diff every field's `inputOptions.required` against
   what you sent** — a misplaced `required` is dropped silently (STEP 2), and this read-back is the
   only signal. If a flag came back `false`, fix it with STEP 4's `PATCH` (moving the flag to
   `inputOptions.required`) rather than deleting and re-creating: the `formId` survives and it costs
   no extra slot against the form cap.
2. **⚠️ Then verify the dashboard will actually render —
   `GET https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms/{formId}/summary` and assert
   `formSummary.fields` is NON-EMPTY**, with a count equal to **every input field you sent** (i.e.
   `formFields[]` minus the `SUBMIT_BUTTON`). A 6-input form returns all 6 — **including non-contact
   `DROPDOWN` and `TEXT_AREA` fields** — so do *not* expect only the contact-mapped ones. This is
   the dashboard-truth check for *placement*. A `summary.fields: []`, or a count short of your
   inputs, means the form renders blank (or partly blank) for the owner even though the public site
   submits fine — **do not report success; fix the layout placement or the GUID casing and
   re-create.**

   **⚠️ This step does NOT prove the `identifier`s are right, so check them in step 1.** An
   unrecognized `identifier` is accepted and stored: it comes back in `formFields[]` and accepts
   submissions, so every API-level check passes — but the **Wix Forms editor cannot render a field
   it doesn't recognize**, so the owner can't see or edit it, and a form built entirely from
   invented identifiers opens **empty** in the editor. Whether such a field is also omitted from
   `formSummary.fields` is unverified, so don't rely on this count to catch it. Assert every
   returned `formFields[].identifier` against the known values in About Form Fields — a plain string
   comparison, no extra call.

3. **⚠️ If the form has a multi-choice ARRAY field (`CHECKBOX_GROUP` / `TAGS`), the two checks above
   are NOT enough — send one real `createSubmission`.** A malformed `arrayOptions.validation.items`
   (missing `itemType`, or an empty/omitted `items`) still lists fine and still counts in the
   summary, so steps 1–2 pass while **every** submission to the form `400`s form-wide (see "Choice
   fields"). The only proof is a live submission:
   `POST https://www.wixapis.com/form-submission-service/v4/submissions` with the standard call
   shape (`<AUTH>`, `Content-Type`, `wix-site-id`) and a minimal valid body — `formId` plus a
   `submissions` map keyed by each field's `target`, the ARRAY field as an **array** of enum values:

   ```jsonc
   { "submission": { "formId": "<formId>",
       "submissions": { "email": "test@example.com", "multi_choice": ["Option 1"] } } }
   ```

   Assert it returns `200`, not `400 SUBMISSION_VALIDATION`. A `400` here means the ARRAY `items`
   shape is wrong — fix it (both `itemType` and `stringOptions.enum`) and re-create. Delete the test
   submission afterward
   (`DELETE https://www.wixapis.com/form-submission-service/v4/submissions/{submissionId}`, the `_id`
   from the response) so the owner's dashboard stays clean.

If a form is missing, its layout didn't persist, or its summary is unexpectedly empty, re-create it
once and re-verify; if it still fails, surface the response verbatim rather than reporting success.

### STEP 4 (when revising): update an existing form

To change a form the request has since revised — add a field, relabel one, tighten a rule — follow
[Update Form](https://dev.wix.com/docs/api-reference/crm/forms/form-schemas/update-form):

```
GET   https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms?namespace=wix.form_app.form&formIds={formId}
PATCH https://www.wixapis.com/form-schema-service/v4/forms/{formId}
{ "form": { …the whole object you just read, with your change…, "revision": "<its current revision>" } }
```

**Read the form back first** — the `PATCH` needs its current `revision`, and `formFields` is replaced
wholesale (anything missing from the array you send moves to `deletedFormFields`), so the read-back
*is* the body. The read needs the **required** `?namespace=wix.form_app.form`; without it it `400`s
with `namespace must not be empty` — a violation naming a field, so it misreads as a body problem.

**Prefer updating over delete-and-recreate.** An update keeps the `formId` the handoff already
carries and consumes no additional slot against the site's form cap. **Re-run STEP 3 after any update**
— it can regress the layout or the dashboard summary exactly as a create can.

---

## Keep — what crosses into the handoff

**Per form: the `formId` + each form's field `target` keys.**

The `target`s are *structural* — the frontend binds each input's `name` to a field's `target` to
submit (the same carve-out shape as cms's `collectionId` + field keys). Everything else — the field
set, order, labels, `required` flags, validation formats and dropdown options — is **read live from
the schema at render time** (visitor token, no `auth.elevate` — `how-to-code-forms.md`), so a field
the owner adds, removes or relabels reflects on the site with no code change. See
`SDK_HANDOFF.md` §4.

---

## Conclusion

Following these steps **in order** sets up a Wix Forms backend:

- Starts from a **clean form list** — pre-existing forms are listed-then-deleted first (a safe no-op
  when none exist), keeping clear of the site's form cap.
- Contains exactly the forms the request calls for, created on **Form Schemas v4** in the
  **`wix.form_app.form`** namespace, each field built per **About Form Fields**, with lowercase GUID
  ids and a `steps` layout placing every field plus a `SUBMIT_BUTTON`.
- Is **verified via `GET .../forms/{formId}/summary`** (non-empty, count equal to every input field
  — contact-mapped or not) — not merely by a `200` on create, and not merely by `steps` being
  present.
- Revises forms with **`PATCH` + the current `revision`** rather than delete-and-recreate, keeping
  the `formId` and the form slot.
- **Keeps** per form the **`formId` + field `target`s** (the immutable submission keys) — the
  frontend reads everything else (labels, options, order) live from the schema.
